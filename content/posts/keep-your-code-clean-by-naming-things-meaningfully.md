Naming things _(= variables, properties, functions, methods, classes)_ correctly and in an understandable way *if an extremely important part of writing clean code.*

Indeed - if poor names are chosen - pretty much all other concepts taught throughout the course will *not help that much.*

## Be Descriptive

Names have *one simple purpose:* They should *describe* what's stored in a variable or property or what a function or method does. Or what kind of object will be created when instantiating a class.

If you keep that in mind, coming up with good names should actually be straightforward - though coming up with the *best name* for a given variable/ property/ function/ ... will of course still require some practice and often *multiple iterations.* That's normal though - clean code is written by iterating and improving code over time!

## Naming Rules

### Variables & Properties

Variables and properties hold data - numbers, text (strings), boolean values, objects,
lists, arrays, maps etc.

Hence *the name should imply which kind of data is being stored.*

Therefore, variables and properties should typically receive a noun as a name. For example: `user, product, customer, database, transaction` etc.

Alternatively, you could also use a *short phrase with an adjective* - typically for storing *boolean values.* For example: `isValid, didAuthenticate, isLoggedIn, emailExists` etc.

Typically, if you can be more specific, you *should* be more specific.

For example, prefer `customer` over `user` if the code at hand is doing customer-specific operations with that data. This makes your code easier to read and understand.

### Functions & Methods

Functions and methods can be called to then execute some code. That means that they perform tasks and operations. 

Therefore, functions and methods should typically receive a verb as a name. For example: `login(), createUser(), database.insert(), log()` etc.

Alternatively, functions and methods can also be used to primarily produce values - then, especially when producing booleans
you could also go for short phrases with adjectives. For example: `isValid(...), isEmail(...), isEmpty(...)` etc.

You should try to avoid names like `email(), user()` etc. These names sound like properties. Prefer `getEmail()` etc. instead.

As with variables and properties, if you can *be more specific*, it typically makes sense to use such more specific names. For example: `createUser()` instead of just `create()`.

### Classes

Classes are used to *create objects* (unless it's a static class). 

Hence the class name should *describe the kind of object it will create*. Even if it's a static class (i.e. it won't be instantiated), you will still use it as some kind of container for various pieces of data and/ or functionality - so you should then describe that container.

Good class names - just like good variable and property names - are therefore *nouns*.

For example: `User, Product,RootAdministrator, Transaction, Payment` etc.

## Avoid Generic Names

In most situations, you should *avoid generic names* like `handle(), process(), data, item` etc.

There can always be situations where it makes sense but typically, you should either make these names more specific (e.g. processTransaction()) or go for a different kind of name (e.g. product instead of item).

## Be Consistent

An important part of using proper names is *consistency*.

If you used `fetchUsers()` in one part of your code, you should also use `fetchProducts()` - and not `getProducts()` - in another part of that same code.

Generally, it doesn't matter if you prefer `fetch...(), get...(), retrieve...()` or any
other term but you should be consistent!
